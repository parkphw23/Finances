As of Jun 2024, I am writing this, the Federal Reserve has again committed to hold at 5.25-5.50% Feds Funds Rate range. Main financial papers such as Bloomberg and WSJ states that Powell has signaled more room for cuts if inflation seems to be down, but I personally am not sure if Powell actually thinks that way. The financial news sector always contain a lot of hopes of the investors, so I'll have to watch the video of his speech and read the transcript. However, stock market has gone up and Treasuries has fallen with the expectation of rate cuts, mainly driven by lower inflation measures such as PPI, CPI, and higher jobless claims. 

It definitely is a very interesting period where so much money is printed. After 2008 financial crisis, Fed under Bernanke went through QE, putting so much money out there. The zero percent interest rate has driven the market into a frenzy of investing into a riskier business, since many pension and insurance funds cannot make money by just parking in the bank. They would need a good percentage to continue serving their customers, driving the Private Equity business boom as well. 

Zero percent interest rate also has changed people's investment decision. Why would you park your money in a savings account if you don't get anything while everything from their life, gas, rent, and food goes up? They would invest into something that will give you a better return, which mainly driven asset inflation. General public buying that real estate, stock, and commodities, and corporations buying much more assets and investing in riskier business like fracking (such as MLP). This component of the economy, I believe, has also driven economic inequality as well.

However, the party is over. Fed had to raise its rate during 2022-23 with price inflation, which they follow unlike asset inflation, going way up. Now the rate is above 5%. As you can imagine, private equity funds have low returns, asset sales slowed down, but stock market is hot? At the same time, people are buying gold because they believe it is so volatile and risky right now? What is going on?

I wish I am more educated in the economics and finance space, but I am merely a chemical engineering major. However, this is my journey to figure out whether there is an answer out there I can find on what really is happening and not learning from the research analyst always just quoting one word that Powell said and putting in their research report. At the same time, it is to figure out my best strategy to my personal finance investing. 

Right now, I think the current stock market is driven by two things: 
1) expectation of rate cuts
2) a strong proponent of QE during Bernanke regime, Janet Yellen, Secretary of Treasury, is printing so much T-bills for the market

Now, I don't fully understand the T-bills impact on liquidity and their recent biggest buyer Hedge Fund's impact on the market too well. However, I do know that there is no real buyer of long term T-notes with Chinese government not buying them and higher government spending increases the GDP of the U.S. that stock market will benefit. I do have the belief that this work is for re-election in Presidential election; however, this is just my suspicision.

I personally think AI is simply a topic that gets the money, not the driver of the market. In other words, there is already money out in the market, and they invest in the topic that is hot. So I guess what I need to do is, 1) know where and how the money moves, 2) predict what will be the next hot topic.

Anyways, to summarize what I want to achieve here are:
1) Figure out what is going on the economy
2) Based on that, make investment choices
3) Other personal finance decision makers
