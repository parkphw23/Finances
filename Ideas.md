I think I can look into...
1) Whether dividends / buyback to continue given higher interest rate
2) My portfolio potential return of this year
3) Does specific date of dollar cost averaging give you more money?
4) Look at different risk figures that I can analyze
5) house price prediction




Reasoning for one:
- i want to look whether SCHD will continue provide the return
- However, isn't SCHD driven by the buybacks and dividend from 2010-2022 under low interest rate?
- So how... would I look into this? hmm
- So look more into dividend trend first of all, that should be the beginning
